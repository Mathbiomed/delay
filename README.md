This repository provides the toolkit for a statistical inference mathod in order to estimate reaction constants of simple Birth-Death process with time delay for the paper on "Bayesian inference of distributed time delay in transcriptional and translational regulation". The Gamma distribution is used for a delay time distribution and inferecne for shape and rate parameter of gamma delay distribution are also included. Estimates of mean and variance of delay time are presented as well as reaction constants and parameter of gamma delay distribution.
